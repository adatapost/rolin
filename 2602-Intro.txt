 Operating System - What is an OS?  
-----------------

  The OS is a kind of system software that  activate the computer hardware,
  initialize them and allow them to interect with software.


  The OS is also a platform or framework in which developers/programmers 
  design the programs, install or deploy the programs and execute these
  programs on behalf of the developers.


  The OS is very low-level platform. It uses "binary numbers system" for
  data & instructions.


  The operating system has following major tasks:

     1. To run the programm -- "process management". A running program is called
        a "process".

     2. To provide memory to the running programs (or processes). This service
	is known as "Memory Management".

     3. To provide different hardware services to the programs or processes.

	For example,  To use the harddisk, monitor, printer, mouse, RAM, ROM and many
			more.

        The OS expose the services to the developers & users in the form of "commands"
        or Application Programming Interface (API) -- also known as the "library".

        It means OS has a toolbox or library that includes thousands of different
  	different tools or functions or APIs. ( tools or functions or APIs means
	ready to use small programs)

 Language of Hardware & Operating System
 ----------------------------------------

 What is the language of Hardware?

    Ans - Short answer is "Binary number system" is the language of Hardware.

    As we know that computer pheripherals are electronics & electricals. They uses
    electric state or pulse to represent the data/value/command/instruction.
    There are two electical state -- On and Off -- just like 1 and 0 in binary number
    system.

       For instance, to delete a file, we need to pass "1000001" instruction to the OS
		     which in form of binary string (series of 1s and 0s) but in case
		     of human interaction, we would like to use "delete" or "remove"
		     like command name.

		User Commands		Binary instructions
		remove			1000001
		create			1000011

 	So, OS provide symbolic name for the instructions and we will call these 
	instructions as "APIs" or "Library".

 That means the language of OS and Hardware is "binary number system". Computer does everything with help of binary numbers.

What is binary number system?
----------------------------

 Generally, we, human, uses "decimal number system". Decimal number system has base of 
 10.

       3  2   1    0
..   10  10  10  10
 
    1000 100 10  1   

  124
         2             1             0
 = 1 x 10   +   2 x  10    + 4  x 10

In binary number system, it has base of 2.
     5   4   3   2   1   0
... 2   2   2   2   2   2

    32  16   8  4   2  1

The OS perform complex translation of binaries to decimals and vice-versa (decimals to binaries) continiously.


How OS perform such translations ( Decimal to Binary and Binary to Decimal)?
--------------

 OS uses following mathematic steps:

1. Decimal to binary

   17 decimal =   10001            

1024 512 256 128 64 32  16   8  4   2  1
                         x   x  x   x  x
                         1   0  0   0  1
                        ------------------
                        16 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 17


 2| 17 | Remainder/Modulo (Shesh)
 -|----|----
 2| 8  | 1
 -|----|----
 2| 4  | 0
 -|----|----
 2| 2  | 0
 -|----|----
 2| 1  | 0
 -|----|----
 2| 0  | 1
 -|----|----   ^
               | Write remainder from bottom to top in left to right direction


2. Binary to decimal

  100001 = 33

 
10 | 100001 |
---|--------|
10 | 10000  | 1
---|--------|
10 | 1000   | 0
---|--------|
10 | 100    | 0
---|--------|
10 | 10     | 0
---|--------|
10 | 1      | 0
---|--------|
10 | 0      | 1

 
How binary number is used to save the electrical pulse - on or off?

Computer memory is made up of electronics registers and each register is 8 division
box.
   7    6    5    4    3    2   1    0     = 8 division
 |----|----|----|----|----|---|----|----|
 |    |    |    |    |    |   |    |    |
 |----|----|----|----|----|---|----|----|

 Each box/division save either on or off state of electrical pulse and we will use metaphore 1 for on and 0 for off for our understanding. Each box or division represent a binary digit hence each box is also known as "bits -- (Bi)nary Digi(ts)".

 So,

 0000 0000  means = 0 decimal value
 0000 0001  means = 1 value
 1111 1111  means = 255 value
 1000 0000  means = 128
                                                       
   
 To measure the memory 1 byte = 8 bits = 1 register

 1024 bytes = 1 Kilo Byte (KB)
 1024 KB = 1 Mega Byte (MB)
 1024 MB = 1 Giga Byte (GB)
 1024 GB = 1 Tera Byte (TB)

 2 bytes = 1 Nibble
 4 bytes = 1 Word

What is software?
-------------------

  It is a collection of related programs.

  There are three major categories of software:
	1. System Software. eg. Operating Systems
	2. Application Software. e.g. Word, Excel, Accounting, Paint brush, Drawing,
					Media etc
	3. Programming or Application Development Software. e.g. C,C++, Java etc


  Name the operating systems exists today.
   ----------------------
   Windows from Microsoft Corp, USA
   Linux from open source community
   Unix from beckerly and other companies
   MacOS from Apple Inc, USA  
	
What is an open source?

   An "open source" is a way to design/develop the software that anyone can use it, or
   modify it or distribute under the "open source agreement". Open source doesn't mean
   free software.

   For example, Linus Torwald is the developer who develop the "Linux" OS in early 80s    under GNU (Not Unix) (Linux is looks a like Unix but it is not a copy of Unix).

   There are thounsand of software under GNU & open source licences. We will use GNU C    compiler/language called (GCC compiler) to develop C and G++ compiler for C++ 
   programming.

   Java platforms are example of open source.

   NetFramework and C# and ASP.NET are example of open source.

   PHP, MySql are example of open source.

   Destro of Linux OS like - UBuntu, Debian, Cento, RedHat are example of open source.

The Operating System and File system
-------------------------------------

Operating System software generally copied into the "Harddisk" - a secondary storage medium.

There are two types of storage devices (Memory Devices):
  1. Primary memory device.

     This device is known as "RAM - Random Access Memory".

     RAM is an addressable memory. Each register/byte is given a unique integral 
     id (number) which is called "address".

|--------------| ....                  32
|              | 4000400300   4 GB  = 2
|--------------| 
|              | ....
|--------------| 
|              | ....
|--------------| 
|              | 10001
|--------------| 
|              | 10000
|--------------| 
|              | .....
|--------------| 
|              | 1                    address
|--------------|           
|              | 0  (byte number 0 )  address
|--------------| 

 The OS format the RAM chip and make it addressable at the time of "booting".

 What is "booting"?
   To boot means to start to run the operating system and the OS activate 
   required hardware.

   When we switch on the computer system and immediately the OS software from the
   Hardisk will be started running and this process is called "booting process".

 Content of RAM or primary memory will be erased or removed as soon as the associated
 or concern program is stopped or even OS is shuts down.

 To store data permanently, we must have to use Seconday Storages like - Hard Disk,
 CDs, DVDs, Pen, ZIP, Magnetic Tape etc.
 
 Seconday Storage mediums are not "addressable" instead they uses "File System"  software to represent the storage oriented actions -- to save, to read, to delete, and
 so on.

 File Systems
 ------------
 This is a very important service of the operating system and it allow us to use the
 Seconday storage devices in the form of "directories (folders)" and files.

 There are different file systems including,
   1. File Allocation Table (FAT)  - older version of Windows 
   2. File Allocation Table 32 FAT32 - older version of windows but it allows max
						4 GB of disk area.
   3. NTFS Network File System - Currently all Win OS uses this software and have no
					limitations.
 The "Format" command of the operating system transfer "File System" software from
 harddisk to Pen or another harddisk or CDs, or DVDs.

 The "File System" create a root directory when you format the disk or device.

 The \  (backslash) is defined as "root" directory. 

 The file system also uses "Volume Label" to name the device and also allows on Windows
 os to define a "Drive letter" e.g E, F G, C, D etc

 c:\  
 ^ ^
 | |--------- Root directory
 |
 Drive
 Letter
 |
 | |-------- Root directory
 V V
 E:\
 
      |---------------- Directory
      V
 c:\Windows\System32 <--- Sub Directory
 ^ ^       ^      
 | |       |--------------- Directory separator
 | |----- Root directory 
 |
Drive
LEtter
 
In Linux, there is a "ExtFS" file system and it do not support drive letter instead we've to use "name or volume name" but there is a root directory.
  e.g    In linux,
    
             \home\download
        or
          \media\pendrive\sample
          \cdrom\sample

What is a file?
 
   It represents the address or location on secondary storage of the data.

 Basically, file is also an address for your data onto the disk and similarly, the folder/directory is also a location of another folder or file.

 For example,  C:\csnet\Rolin\Info\sample.txt

               is called "Path" and it describes the address of your data on the disk.

NOTE: Whenever you format the disk, the OS will re-create a root each time. So you will lose older/previous root and rest other information.


Best practice to save your data onto the disk
----------------------------------------------
Always create your own directory/folder at root of your disk and save your work in the form of files/folders.

Never create too many folders or files directly at root. Keep root directories/files list small.

At root, we've some system and important folders and files so don't delete or rename those files/folders which donot belongs to us.
