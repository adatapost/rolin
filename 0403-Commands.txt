The basic command of OS (Windows)
---------------------------------
There are two types of commands/instructions:

  1. Internal commands - Commands which are the part of OS and always be there.

  			e.g dir, copy, type, date, time, cls, ren, vol, ver, path
			    del, rd, cd, md etc
  2. External commands - Command which may or may not be a part of the OS and they
			 are exists in the form of executables program file or 			 software.

				[In Win OS, .exe, .bat, .cmd, .com files are known
				 as executable/runnable programs].
			Example: calc.exe, nmotepad.exe, mspaint.exe, format.com, 
				 tree.com, diskpart.exe and many more.

The terminal/command prompt/shell/console
-----------------------------------------
In order to operate the OS, we have to issue some commands either using GUI (Graphical User Interface) or CLI (Command Line Interface).
   1. GUI - We uses mouse, touch screens and sometimes keyboard to issue commands.
   2. CLI - We must have to type the command at terminal/console/command prompt.

NOTE that the command of operating system are known as Application Programming Interface (API) of OS.

To start the command prompt press Win Key + R and type - "cmd" command name. The "cmd" is an external command. (Or Start Menu + Run + type "cmd" and press Enter
                         Or Create Shortcut/link)

OR, open command prompt via File Explorer (My Computer). Type "cmd" at location bar and press enter.

To open file explorer from the command prompt, type "start path-of-your-folder".
 For example,
    >start .    Open file explorer of current directory
    >start c:\windows  - for windows dir

				 
1. md or mkdir - create a directory

   Syntax:  md  <<dir-name>> 

2. cd - change directory

   Syntax: cd <<dir-name>>

3. rd - Remove directory

   Syntax:  rd <<dir-name>>

4. dir - Directory and files listing

Example:

c:\users\abc>_    <--- This is current directory
            >cd\  <--- To change to root directory 
c:\>md Work
c:\>dir   
   >cd Work   
c:\Work>dir
    <dir>  .     <--- Current directory symbol
    <dir>  ..    <--- Parent directory symbol
c:\Work>md Office
c:\Work>md Home
c:\work>dir
c:\work>tree     -- tree is an external command to show directories hierarchy 
c:\Work>cd Office
c:\Work\Office>md C
               md Java
              >Dir
Now, create Day1 and Day2 folders/directories into Home folder
c:\Work\Office>cd ..   -- Back to parent
c:\Work>Cd Home
c:\Work\Home>md Day1
             md Day2
c:\Work\Home>dir
c:\Work\home>cd..
c:\work>cd..
c:\>tree Work

RD removes empty directory,
c:\>rd Work  <-- Can't remove because not empty
c:\>cd Work
c:\Work>cd Office
c:\Work\Office>rd C
              >dir
              >rd Java
              >cd..
c:\Work>rd Office
       >dir

Use fully or relative paths for md, cd, and rd operations:
c:\>rd c:\Work\Office\C
c:\>rd c:\Work\Office\Java
c:\>rd c:\Work\Home\day1
c:\>rd c:\Work\Home\day2
c:\>rd c:\Work\Home
c:\>rd c:\Work\Office
c:\>rd c:\Work

Create,
c:\>md Work
c:\>md Work\Office
c:\>md Work\Office\C
c:\>md Work\Office\Java
c:\>md Work\Home
c:\>md Work\Home\Day1
c:\>md Work\Home\Day2
c:\>tree work

Change dirs,
c:\>cd Work\Office\Java   OR c:\>cd C:\Work\Office\Java
c:\Work\Office\Java>  

Enter into Day2
c:\Work\Office\Java>cd c:\Work\Home\Day2   
 OR
c:\Work\Office\Java>cd \Work\Home\Day2   
 OR
c:\Work\Office\Java>cd ..\..\Home\Day2


5. Creating files -- There are numbers of ways to create files. You can use notepad, paint brush, excel, word and many more apps to create files.

1. create hello.txt (via notepad) into \Work\Home\Day1
2. Create pic.png (via paint brush) into \Work\Home\Day2
use tree/f <<dirName>> to list folders along with file.
c:\>tree/f Work
c:\Work\Home\Day1>tree/f ..\..\. 

3. Set "C" as current directory and create "sample.c" file
c:\>cd Work\Office\C
c:\Work\Office\c>notepad sample.c  <--- Notepad will create sample.c in current dir.
                >notepad sample.java 
                >notepad p1        <-- p1.txt file (extension .txt)

4. We can use "copy con <<filename>" command to create a text files.

c:\Work\Office\C>copy con help.txt
Type here something.... and 
..... to save press F6 + Enter (or Ctrl+Z and Enter)
^Z
                 >copy con p1.dat
      ..... ^Z

 >dir

NOTE: The "copy con" command is used to create files on learning basis, we should use suitable editors like notepad, notepad++, write or word software to manipulate the file content.

5. type <<filename1>> <<filename2>> .... - To list the content of file

c:\Work>copy con p1
Firs file ^z
c:\Work>copy con p2
Second file ^z
c:\Work>copy con p3
Third file ^z

c:\Work>type p1
       >type p2 p1 p2 p1 p3 p1 p1 p2 p1

Copy the content of p1, p2 and p3 to p4.txt
c:\work>type p1 p2 p3 > p4.txt     <--- > greater sign is known as re-direction output
c:\work>dir > d-list
c:\Work>type d-list
       >dir
c:\Work>tree/f > t-list
c:\work>tree/f /a > t-list.1   <--- Use ASCII char
       >dir

6. copy <<source-file>> <<new-file>> - Copy a file

c:\work>copy con k1.txt
sadasds
^Z
c:\work>copy k1.txt k2.txt
       >dir
       >copy k1.txt help.abc
       >dir
If "new-file" name is already exists then this command display overwrite? message

7. ren <<existing-fileo-or-folder>> <<new-name>> - Change/rename the file/directory

 c:\work>ren k1.txt keyboard.usa
        >dir
        >md Test
        >dir
        >ren Test Best
        >dir
8. del <<filename>> - delete a file if it exists
   del <<foldername>> - delete all files in a given folder
   Note: You can't undo this action so use this command carefully
   c:\work>del k2.txt
          >dir
          
We may use the "Path" to perform file operations with type, copy, del and ren commands:

1. create a file at "Day2" folder named "just.c"
c:\>copy con c:\Work\Home\Day2\just.c
This is the use of path...^Z

2. copy the just.c file into "C" folder
c:\>copy c:\Work\Home\Day2\just.c  c:\Work\Office\C   <-- if file name is not given 
							  at destination folder then
							  copy will be on same file 							  name.
Copy just.c into "C" with different file name "first.c"
c:\>copy \Work\Home\Day2\just.c \Work\Office\c\first.c

Copy the first.c to Work dir.

c:\Work>copy C:\Work\Office\C\first.c     <---- If destination folder is not specified
						then current directory will be consider
						as destination folder.
Or

c:\Work\Office\C>copy first.c c:\Work
OR
c:\Work\Office\C>copy first.c ..\..\
c:\Work\Office\C>copy first.c ..\..\sample.c

Multiple file copy into a single file,
copy file1+file2+.....  new-file

>copy p1+p2+p3.txt+hello.dat  all.txt
>dir
>type all.txt

Rename the file,
c:\>ren \Work\Office\C\sample.c sample.d
c:\>tree/f Work


Delete a file,
c:\>del c:\Work\Office\C\sample.d
c:\>tree/f Work


10. cls - clear the screen
11. vol - volume label of device
12. ver - version of os
13. Date - get / set the system date
14. time - get /set the system date

15. help - To list basic command list of the OS (internal as well as external) and also
           display help of each command. e.g help dir   or help copy
 					Or command-name /? e.g dir /?


* and ? - Wild card characters - to create a group of files and folders
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
To perform dir, copy, ren and del actions on one or more or certain group of files, we have to use wild card characters.

* - It replaces any character in file & extension
? - It replaces a char in file & extension.

Note: Assume that we've number of files with different name & extension

>dir ?     <- It displays single letter files or dirs
>dir ??    <- It displays two or one letter files or dirs
>dir ?.*   <- It displays single letter files with/without any extension
>dir a*.*  <- begins with a letter having any extension
>dir t*.exe <-- begins with t and .exe extension
>dir *.txt  <-- all files having .txt extension
>dir *.?x   <-- Any file whose extension is two char long and second char is x
>dir *.*    <-- all 


Group copy,
1. Copy all .txt files to new extension .efg
>copy *.txt *.efg
2. copy all file whose name begins with 't' letter to 'k' in new file names.
>copy t*.* k*.*
3. copy all .doc files to "Java" folder
c:\Work>copy *.doc Office\Java
Or
c:\>copy  c:\Work\*.doc c:\Work\Office\Java
4. copy all files of "Work" to "Day1"
c:\Work>copy *.* Home\Day1

Group Rename ,

1. Change .txt extension with .bbb
>ren *.txt *.bbb
2. Change file names
>ren ?e??.* ?7??.*    change second letter 'e' with '7'

Group deletion,
1. delete .txt files
>del *.txt
2. delete all files whose second char is '7'
>del ?7*.*
3. del all files
>del *.*    <--- A confirmation will be displayed

Dir and its switches (extra data to dir command)
>dir /p  <-- list with pause
>dir /w  <-- list in wide format
>dir /w/p  Both, wide format and pause if files count exceed the screenful.
>dir /b  <-- bare format (list file names vertically)
>dir /od <-- order by date in ascending
>dir /o-d <-- order by date in descending 
>dir /os <- order by size
>dir /o-s <-- order by size desc
>dir /s  <-- all files in sub directories
>dir *.txt /s/p
>dir /? to display help

attrib command to set file & dir attributes
--------------------------------------------
A - archive
S - System
H - Hidden
R - Read only

c:\Work>copy con p1.txt
sssd^z
>dir
>attrib +h p1.txt   <-- to set attribute use +AttrChar and remove -AttrChar
>dir   <-- wont' show a file
>dir /ah   <-- To show hidden file
>dir /as   <-- To show system file
>attrib -h p1.txt  
>dir
>attrib   <-- list files along with attributes
> attrib +h +r +s p1.txt  <-- set multiple attributes
>attrib
>attrib -h -r -s p1.txt
>attrib +h *.txt  <-- hide group files
